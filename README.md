# man(1) - The Masters Manual

**WIP Warning: This is a work in progress project!**

This repository contains the sources for `man(1) - The Masters Manual`, a document intended for new first semester students at the [Computer Science faculty](https://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) at the TU Dresden which enrolled for a Master's course.
Its intention is to provide newbies at our university with the knowledge and tips necessary to have a successful start in Dresden.
