# Tips

## Around studies
- Microsoft Imagine & Goodies allerlei
- dudle
- TU webstorage
- nice group work platforms: Overleaf (text editing), Discord/Google Hangouts/Jitsi Meet (calls), Slack (group work - text, code, etc.)
- Git is an important skill, Linux often useful too
- look for conferences at TU that are free to TU members
- pick your supervisors wisely (how do they treat their SHKs, PhD students, what is their reputation when it comes to supervision?) - maybe ask others who have already done projects with them
- always get a clear task description and fix up front what is expected from you - that way it's fixed for grading

## About jobs
- student jobs at uni
- as a student you can't work more than 20 hours (or under 20 hours? TODO) in total per week, this includes jobs outside Germany. The health insurance and tax offices will pay attention to that


## Life
- movie/music torrenting is illegal, trackable and punishable
- bureaucratic offices may give you information only in German, you have the right to take the time and translate everything you need to translate
