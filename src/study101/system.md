# German study system

## General
- there are courses with and (most) without compulsory attendance, check beforehand
- generally: you're responsible for your own success, there's not so much compulsion to prepare for exams etc. (most of the time you can just go and not attend anything during the semester and then just show up to the exam - if that's how you do it best), courses are more like an offer to teach you the things that they will ask in the examination, and if you have problems it's your job to approach the lecturer early to ask for a supporting book or to repeat something in the exercise session that you didn't understand
- ask questions and give feedback so that the lecturers know how people are doing; all questions are encouraged except ones that show that you haven't been listening


## Grade system
- 1.0 - 4.0, what it means

## Module system
- wtf is a module
- how common are continuous assignments
- how are courses graded/ where can you find this info
- how often can you fail a course / how to read Studienordnungen etc.
- you sign up for a course, later you sign up for the exam; except in language courses, there you're automatically signed up for the exam!
- check in the beginning of a course/exercise if assignments will be graded or needed for admission to the exam and if there is deadlines for them
- SWS explanation
- it may be possible to take classes not included in your program and have them acknowledged; to be safe ask beforehand to not "lose" time on that course
- some courses have limited capacities, especially seminars and exercise courses

## Exams
- ideal preparation depends on the course
- sometimes theoretical, sometimes more based on exercises - ask previous years
- there might be mock exams available from the lecturer
- there might be old exams available officially or from student reps or previous students
- written vs. oral: what is expected


## Projects/Theses
- you have to find topic and supervisor yourself
- study regulations tell you how many supervisors you need, registration forms can be found at (->timetable) of your course
- it may be possible to do them in collaboration with companies, but there always has to be at least 1 supervisor from the university
- plan them well in advance to not delay your studies
- there are week limits to these modules
- check if you have to hand in a printed version (= time effort)

## Regulations
- Studienordnung - haben alle Studienordnungen Modulbeschreibungen? - wenn ja: prerequisites for courses can be found there
- Prüfungsordnung
- andere wichtige Sachen? Imma-Ordnung? Etwas über Mitspracherecht der Studierenden?

## Dates and Deadlines
- registrations, deregistrations, exams etc.
- they're sharp
- you are expected to find them out yourself, refer to the timetable part of you course for some guidance
- language course registration is really early (TODO)! in case you have to do language courses
- exams may be conducted shortly after lectures end
- a time overlap in courses or exams can happen and should be sorted out, sometimes you will need to notify the lecturer about it
- due to that, timetable shifts are common in the first weeks
- especially for projects and theses: plan ahead and get the paperwork done because it can take a long time


## Who's who
- examination office: exam registration issues, acknowledgement of modules, course changes, ...
- Prüfungsausschuss: genehmigt Dinge
- Sooryas Funktion: Ansprechpartner für uns
- some degrees have an own administration, for CMS: Fr. Sylvia Wünsch (administrative questions ONLY)
- careful: depending on the question, the professor of the lecture may not be the right addressee of it; if it's about lecture ask the lecturer, if it's about the exercise ask the tutor directly; administration issues go to other people (see 'getting help')
