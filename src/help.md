#Getting help #

## Counselling and Service of the faculty
There are dedicated persons for each master-programm that can help you with the details specific to your course. They often have an office at the faculty and opening times where you can just visit them. 
Under https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/studium/beratung?set_language=en you can find ways to contact them!

## Faculty Council
The faculty council, also iFSR consists of student representatives. They are elected shortly after the winter semester starts and they stand up for your student rights. If you have any trouble with courses, with campus life or just ideas for improvement you can contact the iFSR.  You can find a lot of helpful information on the website https://www.ifsr.de or you can just write to fsr@ifsr.de .

## Exams
If you have any questions regarding your examinations you will have to talk to your examination office. Since this is different for many master programs it is listed with the respective [timetable explanation](timetable.md).
