## picking classes ##
In many courses you will have the freedom to choose courses you want to attend. How many and which courses you can bring into your degree depends on your master-programm, so this will be discussed later again.  
However, there is one central list, where all the couses you can attend to are listed. you can find it here: https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/studium/lehre/lehrangebotskataloge .  
Those lists usually appear a while before the semester starts. They are sorted by summer or wintersemester and in the lists you can just search for the subjects that are specific to your program.   
The "Lehrveranstaltungspl√§ne" (teaching offer plan) usually appear a bit later then the "Lehrangebot" (teaching offer). In contrast to the later, those contain the actual timeslots, when a course will be held.   
Most courses are only offered in the winter-(X) OR summersemester. It usually doesnt change, so if you don't have the latest plan yet, you can look in the past years. If you are looking for more specific information on the classes you should visit their pages, which are mostly linked in the lists. If not, you will find them best by just googeling, since its just faster than navigating through the pages.
