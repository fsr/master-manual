## Other things seniors would like to tell you...
"Good luck"<br>
"Stay strong, guys!"<br>
"The grading system is extremely subjective, so it's not worth bothering with it. Don't focus on your grades, focus on learning and having fun."<br>
"Never be scared to ask questions (in lectures and about organizational stuff)!"<br>
"Learn German and enjoy Dresden, you can do so many fun activities. Also don't get stressed out too quickly, it's normal to sometimes not understand anything in the lectures. The years before you were struggling with a way larger mess and still managed to survive ;)"<br>
